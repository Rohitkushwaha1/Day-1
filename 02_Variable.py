# All Abour Varaiables.
# Variables are the containers who store the data.

Name = "Jack" # Here the Name contains String data type
age = 10 # The Integer data type
height = 5.6 # Float data type

# Rules of naming variable:
    # do not use Numbers at the beginning.
    # do not use special characters except "_"(underscore).
    # use only alphanumeric.
    # make variable readable although it not needed but it is a good practice.
